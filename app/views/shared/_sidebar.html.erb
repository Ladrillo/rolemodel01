<h5><em>1.- a Software Craftsman?</em></h5>

	Say you have an idea for an app. A software craftsman is the guy who will help you transform this idea into a set of specifications, quickly coming up with a minimally functional prototype for you to play with. Work so you both can adapt to evolving requirements. And deliver a product that is functional, elegant, scalable and maintainable.

	I started coding last summer, and there hasn't been a day I haven't done at least a little reading or practice, toward the goal of becoming a journeyman some day. I am already putting my knowledge to use in the real world. It's not the first time I've had to shift gears and change my line of work. I'm used to motivating myself, working under pressure, and with clients.
